Project Title : Web Usage Mining for Understanding User Navigation Patterns in eCommerce
Project Description : This project aims to analyze user navigation patterns in an eCommerce dataset using data mining techniques. The primary focus is on clustering, association rule mining, and sequential pattern mining. The insights gained from this analysis can help improve user engagement and conversion rates by offering personalized recommendations.

Key Features
Basic Dataset exploration to understand the pattern of users.
Clustering: Segmentation of users based on browsing and purchasing behavior using MiniBatch KMeans.
Association Rule Mining: Identifies frequent product combinations to recommend complementary products.
Sequential Pattern Mining: Recognizes common user action sequences to understand user behavior flow.
Visualization: Displays results using various plots and graphs, including heatmaps and network graphs.
