<H4>This project leverages 100,000 data points to deeply analyze user behavior on an eCommerce platform using advanced data mining techniques. The project applies the following "DATA MINING" methods to uncover hidden patterns and provide actionable insights:</H4>

1. Mini Batch K-means Clustering: Identifies distinct user segments based on their behavior, optimizing targeting strategies for personalized marketing.
2. Association Rule Mining: Analyzes purchase patterns and frequently co-occurring products, providing valuable insights for cross-selling and up-selling strategies.
3. Sequence Pattern Mining (PrefixSpan Algorithm): Examines user session flows (e.g., view → cart → purchase), predicting next actions and optimizing user experience through personalized recommendations.
